# Metrics Query Conventions

The collector writes probe output into `metrics.*` partitioned tables.
Those tables intentionally carry no foreign key to `connections` so that
probes never fail because a connection was deleted mid-write. The cost
of that design is that orphaned metric rows can briefly outlive their
owning connection.

## Filter Orphans at Query Time

Any query that reads from `metrics.*` and then feeds the result into a
table with a foreign key on `connection_id` (for example
`metric_baselines`) must INNER JOIN against `connections` in the query
itself. Do not rely on application-level filtering. Do not prune the
orphan rows - they age out with the normal partition lifecycle and a
pruning job is more expensive than the join.

```sql
-- Correct pattern
SELECT m.connection_id, ...
FROM metrics.pg_stat_activity m
JOIN connections c ON c.id = m.connection_id
WHERE m.collected_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day' * $1
```

For queries that use CTEs with window functions (LAG, partitioned by
`connection_id`), place the JOIN inside the innermost CTE so orphaned
rows never enter the window computation:

```sql
WITH db_blocks AS (
    SELECT m.connection_id, m.database_name, m.blks_hit, m.collected_at,
           LAG(m.blks_hit) OVER (
               PARTITION BY m.connection_id, m.database_name
               ORDER BY m.collected_at
           ) AS prev_blks_hit
    FROM metrics.pg_stat_database m
    JOIN connections c ON c.id = m.connection_id
    WHERE m.collected_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day' * $1
)
SELECT ...
FROM db_blocks
WHERE prev_blks_hit IS NOT NULL
```

The canonical example is
`alerter/src/internal/database/queries.go` -
`GetHistoricalMetricValues`. Every one of its metric branches
performs the JOIN. The regression test at
`alerter/src/internal/database/queries_integration_test.go` -
`TestGetHistoricalMetricValues_FiltersOrphanedConnections` - asserts
that every branch filters orphans. When adding a new metric branch,
extend both.

## Schema References

Metrics tables live under the `metrics` schema
(`metrics.pg_stat_activity`, `metrics.pg_stat_database`, etc.). The
`connections` table lives in the default schema (unqualified
`connections`) and is managed by the collector. The alerter and server
both read from `connections` by unqualified name; do not add schema
qualifiers unless the caller's search_path requires it.
