# Metrics Query Conventions

The collector writes probe output into `metrics.*` partitioned tables.
Those tables intentionally carry no foreign key to `connections` so that
probes never fail because a connection was deleted mid-write. The cost
of that design is that orphaned metric rows can briefly outlive their
owning connection.

## Filter Orphans at Query Time

Any query that reads from `metrics.*` and then feeds the result into a
table with a foreign key on `connection_id` (for example
`metric_baselines`) must INNER JOIN against `connections` in the query
itself. Do not rely on application-level filtering. Do not prune the
orphan rows - they age out with the normal partition lifecycle and a
pruning job is more expensive than the join.

```sql
-- Correct pattern
SELECT m.connection_id, ...
FROM metrics.pg_stat_activity m
JOIN connections c ON c.id = m.connection_id
WHERE m.collected_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day' * $1
```

For queries that use CTEs with window functions (LAG, partitioned by
`connection_id`), place the JOIN inside the innermost CTE so orphaned
rows never enter the window computation:

```sql
WITH db_blocks AS (
    SELECT m.connection_id, m.database_name, m.blks_hit, m.collected_at,
           LAG(m.blks_hit) OVER (
               PARTITION BY m.connection_id, m.database_name
               ORDER BY m.collected_at
           ) AS prev_blks_hit
    FROM metrics.pg_stat_database m
    JOIN connections c ON c.id = m.connection_id
    WHERE m.collected_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day' * $1
)
SELECT ...
FROM db_blocks
WHERE prev_blks_hit IS NOT NULL
```

The canonical example is
`alerter/src/internal/database/queries.go` -
`GetHistoricalMetricValues`. Every one of its metric branches
performs the JOIN. The regression test at
`alerter/src/internal/database/queries_integration_test.go` -
`TestGetHistoricalMetricValues_FiltersOrphanedConnections` - asserts
that every branch filters orphans. When adding a new metric branch,
extend both.

## Schema References

Metrics tables live under the `metrics` schema
(`metrics.pg_stat_activity`, `metrics.pg_stat_database`, etc.). The
`connections` table lives in the default schema (unqualified
`connections`) and is managed by the collector. The alerter and server
both read from `connections` by unqualified name; do not add schema
qualifiers unless the caller's search_path requires it.

## Latest-Row Queries (server)

`server/src/internal/metrics/query.go` exposes a latest-row query path
alongside the bucketed `QueryTimeSeries`. It returns the most recent raw
rows of a probe table as flat `map[string]any` objects keyed by real
column name, so dashboards can read individual dimension and timestamp
values directly. The public entry point is `QueryLatestRows`; it is
decomposed into small, separately testable helpers:

- `validateLatestRowParams` validates the probe name, sort direction, and
  connection list, and clamps the limit to `[1, maxLatestRowLimit]` (100).
- `discoverLatestRowColumns` confirms the probe exists, discovers its
  columns via `GetProbeAllColumns`, strips bookkeeping columns with
  `selectLatestOutputColumns` (`connection_id`, `collected_at`,
  `inserted_at`), resolves `order_by` against the discovered columns with
  `ResolveOrderByColumn`, and resolves the database filter column with
  `ResolveDatabaseColumn` when a `DatabaseName` filter is set.
- `buildLatestRowsQuery` assembles the SQL; `scanLatestRows` reads rows
  into flat maps, normalising each value through `normalizeLatestValue`
  (RFC3339 for `time.Time`, `sanitizeFloat` dropping NaN/Inf to JSON
  null, `pgtype.Numeric`/`pgtype.Interval` collapsed to seconds/float).

### Identifier safety and the Codacy suppression

Latest-row SQL interpolates only identifiers drawn from a live-discovered
allow-list: the probe name is checked against
`information_schema.tables`, the `order_by` column against
`GetProbeAllColumns`, and every one is `QuoteIdentifier`-wrapped. All
runtime values bind through `$N` placeholders. golangci-lint/gosec is
satisfied without a `//nolint`, but Codacy's Opengrep flags the
`pool.Query(ctx, query, args...)` call in `QueryLatestRows` as
`go_sql_rule-concat-sqli`. That is a false positive; it is cleared with a
`// nosemgrep: go_sql_rule-concat-sqli` line immediately above the call,
kept alongside the existing justification comment. Use `nosemgrep`, not
`//nolint:gosec`, for Opengrep-only findings.

### Integration tests

DB-executing metrics functions are covered by integration tests in
`server/src/internal/metrics/query_db_test.go` (package `metrics`, so
they can exercise unexported helpers). They follow the api package's
gating convention: skip when `SKIP_DB_TESTS` is set or
`TEST_AI_WORKBENCH_SERVER` is unset, connect via `pgxpool`, and skip on
ping failure, so they run in the Server CI jobs and skip cleanly with no
database. Each test builds its own fixture probe table in the `metrics`
schema with a representative column mix and drops it on cleanup. Error
paths that need a failing query (for example the exists-check branch in
`discoverLatestRowColumns`) are driven with an already-cancelled context;
the scan-error branch in `scanLatestRows` is driven by passing fewer
output columns than the query returns.
